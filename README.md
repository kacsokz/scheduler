# Interview Scheduler

Interview Schedular is a single page React application allowing users to book, edit and cancel interviews. The implimentation of websockets enables a cross-browser, real-time experience. Data is persisted in a PostgreSQL databased and accessed via axios. A TDD approached was used with Storybook, Jest and Cypress.
